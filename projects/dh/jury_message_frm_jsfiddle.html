We are very happy that you wish to participate and with that, bring your fantastic knowledge to the table and help develop the industry.</strong><br><br>
            
<strong>How much work does this involve?</strong><br>
Minimum is to participate at the presentations by the end of the competition. There you will be judging the results by the teams. It is optional, but much appreciated, to be on-site during the competition in case the participants have questions and need guidance. We have just introduced a Coach Program to really put emphasize on the participants and help them as much as we can. During the team forming activity we plan to introduce all the jury members, in order to make it easier for the participants. We have developed a time slot system (with our new Coach Program) if you wish to participate as a coach, please notify us so that we can update the schedule that our participants use:<br><br>

<strong>The judging system - how does it work?</strong><br>
Disclaimer: Do you find anything questionable within the process of judging, feel free to contact us! Each jury member will receive an email by our hackathon software, challengepost. With that email a link to your personal jury site will be included. (Make sure to check out spam filters etc if you don't receive one!) Here is a picture of how the email will look like:
<img src="https://challengepost.s3.amazonaws.com/help/images/Judging%20is%20starting.jpg" width="250"><br>(Note: You will be promted to register at www.challengepost.com in order to begin judging, to speed up the process please register as soon as possible<br>
Then the process follows this procedure:
<ul>
<li>1. Each group which is performing will appear like this:<br><img src="https://challengepost.s3.amazonaws.com/help/images/How%20to%20judge%20for%20judges/rate%20a%20submission.jpg" width="250"></li>
<li>2. Rate the submission (group) in context of the criteria (More about criteria later on!). You'll be able to rate 1-5 stars; 1 star is the lowest rating and 5 is the highest rating. Note: If you do not want to judge a particular submission because of a conflict of interest, you can select the “I recuse myself” checkbox.</li>
<li>3. Press the “Save and Continue” button when the next group walks up on stage. After you have rated all the submissions, you can double-check your progress on the Judging dashboard:<br><img src="https://challengepost.s3.amazonaws.com/help/images/How%20to%20judge%20for%20judges/your%20progress.jpg" width="250"></li>
<li>4. Each submission will reach DreamHackathon crew and look like the picture below. If several submissions (groups) end up with the same rating, a voting round will begin among the jury with DreamHackathon staff as administrators. (In the picture below overall rating will result in the 3 grand prize winners, which is a sum of all the other ratings. "ASDF" and "FDSA" are example critera.<br><img src="https://challengepost.s3.amazonaws.com/help/images/Judges%20progress.jpg" width="250"></li></ul>

<strong>Should I prepare something?</strong>
We think that you will add tremendous to the competition. In general that means the knowledge you already have will benefit the participants. It may however be easier to know your target group, and that’s why we’ve added a few great tips:
    <ul><li>Head to our community page for the latest news about the competition and the content.</li>
        <li>Follow <a href="http://twitter.com/DreamHackathon">@Dreamhackathon</a> to stay in the loop easier and if your colleagues or friends want to follow the competition we will live-blog the event via <a href="http://twitter.com/DHackathon_live">@DHackathon_live</a></li></ul>
            <p><strong>How to get there and what to expect</strong><br>
                DreamHackathon will be hosted in a part of Globe Arenas. To get to the area, head to the main entrance to DreamHack Stockholm 2014, located <a href="https://www.google.se/maps/place/Ericsson+Globe/@59.2941883,18.0837753,16z/data=!4m2!3m1!1s0x465f7826c8abcc0f:0x1d7a9835ba7d7f96">here</a>. The easiest way to get there is probably with public transports, more information about that <a href="http://sl.se/en/">here.</a>
<br><br>
                You’ll be greeted by a fantastic venue which breaths creative freedom! We will have a partner and coach area on a balcony which oversee DreamHackathon from above. We will place sofas and tables for you to utilize. Some of these areas are dedicated to our partners, the other areas will use a first-come-first-serve system:<center><img src="http://master.dreamhack.se/stockholm14/files/2014/09/DreamHackathon_area_map_large.png" width="500" height="290"></p></center>
